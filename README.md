# sort-algorithms-implementation-JAVA

Implementations of insertion ,selection , bubble , merge ,quich and heap sort algorithms.
Test these algorithms for best average and worst case.
To see which one is good for which situation.
Example Execution:
Execution Times For Sorted Numbers : 
Insertion Sort = 277ms  Selection Sort = 236ms  Bubble Sort = 414ms
Merge Sort = 9ms  Quick Sort = 9ms  Heap Sort = 19ms

Execution Times For Reverse Order Numbers : 
Insertion Sort = 266ms  Selection Sort = 202ms  Bubble Sort = 440ms
Merge Sort = 3ms  Quick Sort = 5ms  Heap Sort = 11ms

Execution Times For Random Number : 
Insertion Sort = 321ms  Selection Sort = 195ms  Bubble Sort = 432ms
Merge Sort = 4ms  Quick Sort = 4ms  Heap Sort = 9ms
